ecNumber*3.2.1.179#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*enzyme activity is measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 235 nm, corresponding to the loss of the C=C double bond of the substrate because the pyranose ring of the released DELTAGlcA readily opens so that it is nonenzymatically converted to alpha-keto acid through the loss of the double bond#organism*Bacillus sp.

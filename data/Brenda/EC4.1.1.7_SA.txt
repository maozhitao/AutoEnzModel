ecNumber*4.1.1.7#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*After 24 h of catalytic activity the immobilized biocatalyst Sepabeads EC-EA/BFD showed a remaining activity of 5% of its initial value.; specific activity of around 62 U/g dry carrier. The activity is determined for the reaction of acetaldehyde (500 mM) and benzaldehyde (50 mM) at pH 8.0; Stability of Sepabeads EC-EA/BFD is determined by repetitive batch experiments while carrying out the synthesis of 2-hydroxy-1-phenylpropanone. The reaction of benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde is carried out at 30&deg;C and after each batch is washed. The decrease of the initial reaction rate is followed for six batches. The newly prepared biocatalyst (enzyme loading 320 mg/g) shows an initial reaction rate of 130 U/g carrier with respect to the C-C-coupling reaction, whereby the rate decreases down to 10% (13 U/g) in the sixth batch.#organism*Pseudomonas putida#literature*691346#!ecNumber*4.1.1.7#specificActivity*11#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*activity of free BFD#organism*Pseudomonas putida#literature*691346#!ecNumber*4.1.1.7#specificActivity*16.8#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*#organism*Pseudomonas putida#literature*4810#!ecNumber*4.1.1.7#specificActivity*138#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*#organism*Pseudomonas putida#literature*4811#!ecNumber*4.1.1.7#specificActivity*193#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*#organism*Pseudomonas putida#literature*4799#

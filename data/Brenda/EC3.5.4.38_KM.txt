ecNumber*3.5.4.38#kmValue*-999#kmValueMaximum*#substrate*more#commentary*Km of glutathione S-transferase-AID for the hot-spot transcription bubble substrate HS1bub7 is between 10 and 15 nM. It is not possible to estimate the Km for the cold-spot bubble (i.e., CS1bub7) since the substrate saturation kinetics is not observed. However, as the velocity continues to increase beyond the highest substrate concentration tested, the Km is likely to be severalfold higher for CS1bub7 than for HS1bub7#organism*Homo sapiens#ligandStructureId*#literature*688963#

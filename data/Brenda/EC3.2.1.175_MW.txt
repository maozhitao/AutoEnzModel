Dehydration rapidly induces polymerization of AtBG1, resulting in a 4fold increase in enzymatic activity. Diurnal increases in abscisate levels are attributable to polymerization-mediated AtBG1 activation#organism*Arabidopsis thaliana#literature*708075#!ecNumber*3.2.1.175#molecularWeight*98000#molecularWeightMaximum*#commentary*x * 98000, GFP-tagged enzyme, SDS-PAGE#organism*Arabidopsis thaliana#literature*732628#

ecNumber*3.2.1.B3#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*cg2927 gene corresponds to the scrB gene and encodes sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase, recombinant protein hydrolyzes sucrose 6-phosphate, sucrose 6-phosphate much more effective than sucrose as substrate, deletion mutant does not grow on sucrose as the sole carbon source, growth in the absence of enzyme activity severely decreased when sucrose is present in addition to glucose, fructose or acetate, transcriptional start sites analyzed, sucrose 6-phosphate hydrolase activity increased during growth in fructose- or sucrose-containing media, overexpression increases hydrolase activity sevenfold, no activity in the scrB deletion mutant#organism*Corynebacterium glutamicum#literature*692397#

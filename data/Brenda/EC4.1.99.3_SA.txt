However, upon comparing ES114 to a phr mutant, consisting of an in-frame deletion of the gene, and a dark deltaluxCDABEG mutant, it is shown that bioluminescence does not affect photolyase-mediated resistance to UV light. Results indicate that in Vibrio fischeri strain ES114, the benefits of bioluminescence during symbiotic colonization are not mediated by photolyase, and no evidence is found that light production supports cells by stimulating photolyase in this strain.#organism*Aliivibrio fischeri ES114#literature*677676#!ecNumber*4.1.99.3#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*medium-pressure UV irradiation results in a greater reduction in photolyase activity than low-pressure UV radiation.

Exposure of a CPD photolyase solution to UV-C (254 nm) reduces enzyme activity and induces accumulation of H2O2. Addition of H2O2 to the enzyme solution also inactivates CPD photolyase activity; polychromatic UV- irradiation increases activity of CPD photolyase by an amount which depends on UV irradiance, and the level of CsPHR transcripts temporarily increases before the activity reaches a constant level.

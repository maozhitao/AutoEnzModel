Because of this complex behaviour of the oxygenase system, the apparent Km value for benzoyl-CoA can only be estimated from the time curve of benzoyl-CoA concentration in an assay mixture that contains BoxAB and the putative ring-cleaving enzyme BoxC. This curve shows a half-maximal rate at a benzoyl-CoA concentration of 0.03 mM#organism*Aromatoleum evansii#ligandStructureId*394#literature*700258#

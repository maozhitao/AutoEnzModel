cathepsin S genotypes are associated with Apo-A1 and HDL-cholesterol in lean and obese French populations; CTSS circulating levels are increased in obese individuals and decreased following weight loss induced by gastric surgery; CTSS contributes independently to plasma Apo-A1 and HDL-Clevels in both healthy and obese populations, with the most prominent CTSS polymorphism (rs10888390) explaining 3.8% of the variance in plasma Apo-A1 phenotype levels in obese women; CTSS sequence variations are associated with two human metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, plasma Apo-A1 and HDL-C concentrations; CTSS sequence variations are associated with two human metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseases: plasma Apo-A1 and HDL-C concentrations;

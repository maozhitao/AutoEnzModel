Extended incubation also reveals a biphasic cleavage profile, incubation of 2Apro with recombinant His-poly(A) binding protein results in relatively poor and variable cleavage ranging from 0-20%, this suggested that most purified protein usually exists in a conformation not suitable for 2Apro recognition and binding#organism*coxsackievirus#literature*701390#!ecNumber*3.4.22.29#specificActivity*8.8#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*human rhinovirus type 2#organism*Human rhinovirus sp.#literature*648037#!ecNumber*3.4.22.29#specificActivity*550#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*#organism*Enterovirus C#literature*648033#

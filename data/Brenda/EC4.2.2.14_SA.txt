ecNumber*4.2.2.14#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*immobilized glucuronan lyase activity is calculated for deacetylated glucuronan. The activity is 1300times less than the theoretical immobilized activity. Activity decreases 4times and 14times for native and highly acetylated glucuronans, respectively#organism*Trichoderma sp.#literature*691646#!ecNumber*4.2.2.14#specificActivity*162#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*#organism*Trichoderma sp.#literature*663738#

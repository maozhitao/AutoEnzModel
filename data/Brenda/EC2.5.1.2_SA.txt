ecNumber*2.5.1.2#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*a method for measuring thiaminase I activity in complex samples is described. This assay is based on the selective consumption of the highly chromophoric 4-nitrothiophenolate by thiaminase I, resulting in a large decrease in absorbance at 411 nm. This assay is simple and sensitive, and it requires only readily available chemicals and a visible region spectrophotometer. The assay is optimized for high-throughput analysis in a 96-well format with complex biological samples; method for measuring thiaminase activity in complex samples. The assay is based on the selective consumption of the highly chromophoric 4-nitrothiophenolate by thiaminase I, which is able to use a variety of nucleophiles as cosubstrates. This assay is sensitive and uses readily available chemicals and a visible region spectrophotometer. In addition, the assay can be easily performed in a high-throughput fashion in either 96- or 384-well plates#organism*Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus#literature*684401#!ecNumber*2.5.1.2#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*average thaminase activity is 7.2 microM per g and min.

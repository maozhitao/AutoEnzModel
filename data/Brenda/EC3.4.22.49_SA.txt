Absence of Esp1 activity: only a minor mitotic exit delay observed which is consistent with a Cdc14 early anaphase release defect. Esp1 overexpression drives mitotic exit in Cdc20-depleted cells arrested in metaphase. Activity of overexpressed Esp1 depends on spindle integrity and the mitotic exit network.#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#literature*700098#

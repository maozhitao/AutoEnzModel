The complex consists of two separable enzymatic activities: a formate dehydrogenase and a hydrogenase, SDS-PAGE#organism*Escherichia coli#literature*698686#!ecNumber*1.17.99.7#molecularWeight*80000#molecularWeightMaximum*#commentary*gel filtration#organism*Escherichia coli#literature*698704#!ecNumber*1.17.99.7#molecularWeight*105000#molecularWeightMaximum*#commentary*anaerobic oxidation of formate by Methanococcus vannielii is catalyzed by two readily separable formate dehydrogenases. One of these is a 105000 Da protein that contains molybdenum, iron, and acid-labile sulfide, but not selenium. The other is a high molecular weight complex composed of selenoprotein and molybdo-iron sulfur protein subunits#organism*Methanococcus vannielii#literature*727803#

To determine the kinetic parameters of KtzO catalyzed hydroxylation, the problem of the labile thioester bond is circumvented by using synthetic coenzyme A analogs coupled to glutamic acid where the thioester is replaced by a hydrolytically stable amide bond#organism*Kutzneria sp. 744#ligandStructureId*#literature*725193#

ecNumber*2.4.1.173#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*the activity obtained with dehydroepiandrosterone is 100%. 3-beta-hydroxy-pregna-5,16-dien-one, transandrosterone, 3-beta-hydroxy-16, 17-alpha-epoxy-pregnenolone, pregnenolone, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, ergosterol, brassicasterol and solasodine give activities with the enzyme SGTL1. 5-alpha-cholestan-3-beta-ol and cholesterol show no activity with the enzyme. Activity is assayed radiometrically using UDP-[U-14C] glucose, at pH 8.0 and 37&deg;C#organism*Withania somnifera#literature*671624#!ecNumber*2.4.1.173#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*the cytosolic enzyme shows 100% activity with 24-methylene chloseterol as substrate. Using Dehydroepiandrosterone, Stigmasterol, Brassicasterol, beta-sitosterol or Deacetyl-16-DPA the activtity is 75% - 44%. Using Diosgenin, Solasdine or Pregnenolene the activity is 31,5% - 14.1%. Using Cholesterol, 20S,22R-1alpha, 3beta-dihydroxy-witha-5,24-dienolide, Hecogenin, Tigogenin, Quercetin or Daidzein the activity is 8.9% - 2.1%. There is no activity, when using Euphol, Ursolic acid, Testosterone, Estradiol or Single glucose withanolide as substrate. Sterol glucosyltransferase activity is monitored radiometricaly using UDP-[U-14C] glucose as the radioactive substrate in the radioactive substrate; the membrane bound enzyme shows 100% activity with 24-methylene chloseterol as substrate. Using Deacetyl-16-DPA, beta-sitosterol, Brassicasterol, Dehydroepiandrosterone, Pregnenolene, Stigmasterol or Cholesterol the activtity is 577% - 124%. The enzyme shows 2% activity with Diosgenin as substrate. It does not show any activity with Solasodine 16,17alpha-epoxy prednenolene, Hecogenin, 20S,22R-1alpha, 3beta-dihydroxy-witha-5,24-dienolide, Tigogenin, Quercetin, Daidzein, Euphol, Ursolic acid, Testosterone, Estradiol or Single glucose withanolide.#organism*Withania somnifera#literature*672427#

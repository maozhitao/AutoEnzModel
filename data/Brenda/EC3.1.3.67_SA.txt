PTEN can exist in 2 active states, one favouring metabolism of soluble substrates and the interfacially activity state is necessary for efficient metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.; regulation of PTEN activity and expression serves not only to modulate the temporal and spatial distribution of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate but also its availability for an alternative route of metabolism to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by 5-phosphatases; the scale of the interfacial activation when PTEN associates with a membrane or vesicular substrate depends largely on the composition of the membrane and particularly its surface characteristics, these includes the overall surface charge, largely determined both by its phosphatidylserine content and on the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate#organism*Homo sapiens#literature*694495#!ecNumber*3.1.3.67#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*activity of PTEN is dependent on extent of membrane binding, phosphorylation of the C-terminal cluster has an inhibitory effect on membrane association and activity; alanine substituted PTEN is 7fold more active than wildtype PTEN; PTEN cellular activity is proportional to the extent of membrane association#organism*Homo sapiens#literature*694916#!ecNumber*3.1.3.67#specificActivity*-999#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*carbonylation of PTEN increases significantly in ethanol-fed mice compared to pair-fed control animals, corresponding to decreased PTEN3-phosphatase activity#organism*Mus musculus#literature*731861#!ecNumber*3.1.3.67#specificActivity*6.7#specificActivityMaximum*#commentary*#organism*Rattus norvegicus#literature*682679#

ecNumber*4.2.99.B1#molecularWeight*-999#molecularWeightMaximum*#commentary*polymerase theta is a ca. 300 kDa polypetide. The 98-kDa C-terminal region possesses both the DNA polymerase and the dRP lyase activity. The 5'-dRP lyase activity is independent of the polymerase activity. The polymerase inactive mutant D829N/E830Q retains full 5'-dRP lyase activity. Domain mapping of the 98-kDa enzyme reveals that the 5'-dRP lyase active site resides in a 24-kDa-domain#organism*Homo sapiens#literature*694467#!ecNumber*4.2.99.B1#molecularWeight*38200#molecularWeightMaximum*#commentary*NEIL2, protein part of the enzyme-DNA complex, when trapped by the addition of NaBH4 to the dRP lyase activity assay.

KM	Hordeum vulgare	1.8	p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside	*pH 4.8, 37&Acirc;&deg;C
KM	Arabidopsis thaliana	0.41	beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate	*pH 6.0, 35&Acirc;&deg;C
MW	Arabidopsis thaliana	60000	*	*10 * 60000, main peak of AtBG1 in dehydration-stressed plants. Dehydration rapidly induces polymerization of AtBG1, resulting in a 4fold increase in enzymatic activity. Diurnal increases in abscisate levels are attributable to polymerization-mediated AtBG1 activation

MW	Cricetulus griseus	-999	*	*ALG7 1.5 kb mRNAs appears to be initiated at a start site downstream from that used by the 1.9 and 2.2 kb species and located bentween two in-frame ATG codons. Translation of these transcripts in vitro provides supporting evidence that the 1.5 and 1.9 kb transcripts are translationally competent, giving rise to related protein isoforms with different lengths of their NH2-terminal domains. The 1.9 kb mRNA serves in the synthesis of 36000 Da and 24000 Da species, as well as a low abundance 32000 Da protein. The 1.5 kb transcript gives rise to a translation product of 32000 Da

KM	Yersinia pestis	0.000145	plasminogen	*
MW	Yersinia pestis	31000	*	*plasminogen activator Pla exhibits three molecular forms: alpha-Pla with an MW of 35000 Da, beta-Pla of 33000 Da and gamma-Pla with 31000 Da. the formation of beta-Pla from alpha-Pla results from autoprocessing at the residue Lys262. gamma-Pla most likely represents full-size mature Pla that has folded differently from alpha-Pla
MW	Yersinia pestis	32600	*	*alpha-Pla, x * 32600, a transient 34600 Da primary Pla product is processed upon insertion into the outer membrane to yield alpha-Pla, deduced from nucleotide sequence
MW	Yersinia pestis	33000	*	*plasminogen activator Pla exhibits three molecular forms: alpha-Pla with an MW of 35000 Da, beta-Pla of 33000 Da and gamma-Pla with 31000 Da. the formation of beta-Pla from alpha-Pla results from autoprocessing at the residue Lys262. gamma-Pla most likely represents full-size mature Pla that has folded differently from alpha-Pla

SA	Yersinia pestis	-999	*	*peptide synthesis described, DABCYL/EDANS quencher/fluorophor system used, minimal substrate length determined, positional scan approach applied, peptide sequences tested as substrates and functional inhibitors listed, kinetics of cleavage of identified fluorescent substrates shown, fluorimetric assay and fibrinolytic assay applied, analysis of six-residue peptides and optimization studies of potential tripeptide substrates performed, inhibitory activity od selectetes small-peptides analyzed
SA	Legionella pneumophila	-999	*	*expression of Lpa gene shown in exponential and stationary growth phase, transcription shown to be directed by own promoter
SA	Yersinia pestis	-999	*	*kinetics of infection summarized, lack of plasminogen activator Pla shown to delay the time to death resulting from respiratory infection of mice, plasminogen activator Pla shown to control proliferation of Yersinia pestis in the lungs but is not essential for bacteria to disseminate, aborted inflammation and activated lung repair shown in absence of expression of plasminogen activator Pla

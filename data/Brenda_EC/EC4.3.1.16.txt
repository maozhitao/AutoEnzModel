MW	Pseudomonas sp. T62	36000	*	*determined by using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, measured value is lower than that determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (40 kDa), and that of the enzyme purified from the original strain (approximately 39 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The discrepancy may be due to the surface charge of the protein or some unknown factors such as the conformation of the enzyme

MW	Acidaminococcus fermentans	42000	*	*because electron transferring flavoprotein (EtfAf) and butanoyl-CoA dehydrogenase (BcdAf) are separated proteins in solution, a transient Bcd-Etf complex is sufficient to perform a bifurcation process. Electron transferring flavoprotein (EtfAf) is a heterodimer with a molecular mass of around 66 kDa (theoretically 37600 + 28400 Da). Butanoyl-CoA dehydrogenase (BcdAf) is homotetrameric flavoprotein (4 * 42000 Da)

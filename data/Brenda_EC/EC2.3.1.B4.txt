The large complex appears to be composed of 12 PhaC subunits and 12 PhaE subunits (dodecamer). The small complex appears to be composed of 6 PhaC and 6 PhaE subunits (hexamer). In dilute aqueous solution, the synthase is predominantly composed of hexamer and has low activity accompanied with a significant lag period at the initial stage of reaction. The percentage of dodecameric complex increases with increasing salt concentration. The dodecameric complex has a greatly increased specific activity for the polymerization of (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and a negligible lag period.

SA	Mentha spicata	-999	*	*increase in the expression of the spearmint LS cDNA at the different leaf developmental stages is accompanied with increases in the limonene content of transgenic spike lavender lines; leaves of transgenic plants contain increased limonene contents (more than 450% increase compared to controls) that correlates with the highest transcript accumulation of the LS gene.; the effect of the LS expression on oil composition decreases with leaf age as compared to the control; transgenic T0 spike lavender lines overexpressing MsLS show quantitative and qualitative alterations in their terpene profiles, particularly increased amounts of limonene as compared to controls (from 19.05% to 53.97% and from 12.50% to 83.33% in pooled leaves and flowers, respectively). The levels of other monoterpene pathway components are not consistently altered in either leaf or flower oils

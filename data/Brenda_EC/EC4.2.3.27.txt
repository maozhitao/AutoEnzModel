SA	Populus nigra	-999	*	*A much higher PnISPS activity sustains high rates of isoprene emission in plants grow at 35&deg;C before drought stress. Large reductions of PnISPS activity have no relevant effect on isoprene emission in conditions of mild drought stress. The PnISPS activities of leaves grown at 35&deg;C do not recover the original rates once drought stress is relieved.; ISPS activity decreases before isoprene emission during drought development, indicating a tighter control of the emission at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level under moderate drought stress, at 25&deg;C and 35&deg;C.; PnISPS activity is generally related to isoprene emission rates along the drought treatment; Prior to the imposition of drought stress, plants grown at 35&deg;C show much higher PnISPS activities than plants grown at 25&deg;C. Drought stress negatively influences PnISPS activity, especially in plants grow at 35&deg;C. In these plants, PnISPS activity starts to decrease when drought stress is mild and only partially recovered after re-watering. In plants grown at 25&deg;C, the inhibition of PnISPS activity occurred more slowly and only became evident when the stress is severe. At 25&deg;C, PnISPS activity recovers rapidly and completely upon re-watering.
SA	Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides	-999	*	*activity of isoprene synthase remains constant during postillumination process; isoprene synthase mainly operates under substrate limitation and short-term light, CO2 and O2 dependencies of isoprene emission result from variation in dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size rather than from modifications in isoprene synthase activity; maximum capacity of isoprene synthase of Vmax of 110 nmol/qm/s are estimated

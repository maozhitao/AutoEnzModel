KM	Lithobates catesbeianus	-999	more	*network-weaving algorithm that passes threads of an allosteric network through highly correlated residues using hierarchical clustering, the residue-residue correlations are calculated, modeling, overview. The ferritin structures evolved in a way to limit the influence of functionally unrelated events in the cytoplasm on the allosteric network to maintain stability of the translocation mechanisms, allosteric mechanisms observed among homologous proteins, overview

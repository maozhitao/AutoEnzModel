SA	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	-999	*	*The protease activity of Esp1 is required for anaphase spindle elongation in Mcd1-depleted cells (Mcd1 is a subunit of cohesin)
SA	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	-999	*	*Esp1 contributes to mitotic exit kinetics mainly through cohesin cleavage. Absence of Esp1 activity: only a minor mitotic exit delay observed which is consistent with a Cdc14 early anaphase release defect. Esp1 overexpression drives mitotic exit in Cdc20-depleted cells arrested in metaphase. Activity of overexpressed Esp1 depends on spindle integrity and the mitotic exit network.

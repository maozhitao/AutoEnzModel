SA	Papaver somniferum	-999	*	*phylogenetic analysis reveales a monophyletic clade for (S)-coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT) and (S)-tetrahydroprotoberberine cis-N-methyltransferase (TNMT), 48% identity of amino acid sequence, downstream metabolic role suggests that TNMT derives from gene duplication after more ancient recruitment of CNMT, phylogenetic relationship between CNMT and TNMT provides new insights into evolutionary recruitment of enzymes into plant alkaloid pathways
SA	Coptis japonica	-999	*	*(S)-corytuberine conversion to magnoflorine shown by crude enzyme preparation of recombinant CNMT protein, magnoflorine biosynthesis by CYP80G2 protein and CjCNMT via (S)-corytuberine as an intermediate in vivo, CjCNMT protein catalyzes the crucial N-methylation step from (S)-coclaurine to (S)-N-methylcoclaurine in (S)-reticuline biosynthesis

MW	Escherichia coli	6900	*	*2 * 6900, MoaD, + 2 * 16500, MoaE, SDS-PAGE, composed of two small MoaD and two large subunits MoaE. Both forms of MoaD, carboxylated and thiocarboxylated, are monomeric and are able to form a heterotetrameric complex after coincubation in equimolar ratios with MoaE, but only the thiocarboxylated MPT synthase complex is able to convert precursor Z in vitro to MPT

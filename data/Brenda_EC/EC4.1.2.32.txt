SA	Aminobacter aminovorans	-999	*	*specific activity is much higher in ultrasonic extracts of Pseudomonas aminovorans grown on methylamine than in cells grown on trimethylamine and trimethylamine N-oxide, low activity in trimethylamine and trimethylamine N-oxide grown cells is due to the presence of an inactivating factor. The inactivating factor is absent from methylamine-grown cells

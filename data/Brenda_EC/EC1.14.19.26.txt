KM	Thunbergia alata	-999	palmitoyl-[acyl-carrier protein]	*Km-values determined for the wild-type enzyme and mutant A188G/Y189F are in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 mM with both 16:0- and 18:0-[acyl-carrier protein], suggesting that, at least in the case of these enzymes, changes in the substrate binding properties can be discounted as an underlying cause of differences in activities

KCAT	Homo sapiens	0.0075	DNA with a 5'-incised apurinic/apyrimidinic site at position 21	*dRP lyase activity of beta-pol. To quantify the kinetic parameters for the release of deoxyribose phosphate from a preincused apurinic/apyrimidinic site-containing DNA, deoxyribose phosphate is examined as a function of apurinic/apyrimidinic site concentration. The catalytic efficiency results in a kcat/Km: 0.00015 mM/s. The catalytic efficiency of the 8-kDa amino-terminal domain is 7fold lower than that of the intact 39-kDa beta-pol

MW	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*polymerase theta is a ca. 300 kDa polypetide. The 98-kDa C-terminal region possesses both the DNA polymerase and the dRP lyase activity. The 5'-dRP lyase activity is independent of the polymerase activity. The polymerase inactive mutant D829N/E830Q retains full 5'-dRP lyase activity. Domain mapping of the 98-kDa enzyme reveals that the 5'-dRP lyase active site resides in a 24-kDa-domain

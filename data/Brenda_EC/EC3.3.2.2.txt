KCAT	Rattus norvegicus	10.3	lysoplasmenylcholine	*pH 7.1, temperature not specified in the publication. Coupled enzyme assay, the aldehyde that is produced by hydrolysis of lysoplasmalogen is reduced to an alcohol in a second enzymic reaction. In the second reaction, NADH is oxidized in a 1:1 stoichiometry between the mol of aldehyde produced and mol of NADH oxidized

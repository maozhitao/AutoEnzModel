SA	Bos taurus	-999	*	*PTEN is inactivated in bovine aortic endothelial cells exposed to cyclic strain. Inhibition of PTEN activity has no effect on cyclic strain-mediated cell proliferation but inhibits cyclic strain mediated suppression of apoptosis
SA	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*loss of PTEN activity in the Hep-G2 cell line leads to activation of lipogenesis, as evidenced from increased mRNA levels for sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase; modulation of PTEN influences the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mass and lipid transfer activity; PTEN protein levels are significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner with PTEN wildtype and PTEN C124S mutant overexpression at both 5 and 20 multiplicity of infection (moi) in Hep-G2 cells
SA	Mus musculus	-999	*	*loss of PTEN activity in knockout mice modell leads to activation of lipogenesis, as evidences from increased mRNA levels for sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase; modulation of PTEN influences the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mass and lipid transfer activity; protein levels of PTEN in the liver of 13-week-old male mice with PTEN liver-specific knockout are significantly decreased to 16% of that in the control mice; PTEN overactivity have a profound inhibitory effect on insulin signaling downstream of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and can readily induce insulin resistance
SA	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*PTEN is an interfacially activated enzyme. PTEN can exist in 2 active states, one favouring metabolism of soluble substrates and the interfacially activity state is necessary for efficient metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate.; regulation of PTEN activity and expression serves not only to modulate the temporal and spatial distribution of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate but also its availability for an alternative route of metabolism to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by 5-phosphatases; the scale of the interfacial activation when PTEN associates with a membrane or vesicular substrate depends largely on the composition of the membrane and particularly its surface characteristics, these includes the overall surface charge, largely determined both by its phosphatidylserine content and on the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
SA	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*activity of PTEN is dependent on extent of membrane binding, phosphorylation of the C-terminal cluster has an inhibitory effect on membrane association and activity; alanine substituted PTEN is 7fold more active than wildtype PTEN; PTEN cellular activity is proportional to the extent of membrane association
SA	Mus musculus	-999	*	*carbonylation of PTEN increases significantly in ethanol-fed mice compared to pair-fed control animals, corresponding to decreased PTEN3-phosphatase activity

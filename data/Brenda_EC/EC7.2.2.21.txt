KM	Listeria monocytogenes	-999	more	*the range of 0.1-10 microM of added CdCl2 corresponds to Cd2+ binding at the transport site of unphosphorylated enzyme which induces the reaction of the enzyme with ATP and impairs the reaction with phosphate. The 0.1-1 mM range of added CdCl2 corresponds to Cd2+ binding to the transport site accessible from the extracellular medium

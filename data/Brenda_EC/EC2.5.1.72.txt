SA	Bacillus subtilis	-999	*	*discontinuous enzymatic assay that couples the production of iminoaspartate by NadB with the condensation between DHAP and iminoaspartate to form quinolinic acid catalyzed by NadA. The assay is linear up to 0.25 mg of NadA, 10 microg of NadB is the lowest amount suitable to measure NadA activity, and under anaerobic conditions, NadA activity becomes independent of fumarate concentration, starting from 1 mM fumarate, but decreases at concentrations higher than 2 mM fumarate, due to inhibition of NadB by fumarate

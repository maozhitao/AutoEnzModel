KCAT	Aeropyrum pernix	-999	more	*catalytic rate constants for wild-type enzyme and selected mutants, in the presence of PCNA (proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen), towards a splayed duplex and a 3' flap substrate
KCAT	Saccharolobus solfataricus	-999	more	*the best substrate is a 3' flap structure, which is cut too quickly to allow accurate determination of the reaction rate using manual sampling methods. This rate is estimated as 6.8 per min. The splayed duplex is cleaved at a rate of 0.60 per min, at least 10-fold more slowly than the 3' flap substrate, and the fixed four-way junction is cut with a rate of 0.057 per min, 10fold more slowly than the splayed duplex and 100fold more slowly than the flap substrate. As the four-way junction is cut in all four arms, the true rate of cleavage of this substrate is probably fourfold faster

SA	Mus musculus	-999	*	*Despite lack of detectable in vitro RNA 2'-phosphotransferase activity in lysates of cells derived from the Trpt1 knockout mice, there is no evidence for a defect in the unfolded protein response or in tRNA function.; Immunoprecipitation of Trpt1 from heart lysates, followed by immunoblot with an antiserum raised to bacterially expressed murine Trpt1 reveals that Trpt1-/-mice lack 2'-phosphotransferase activity yet retain the ability to translate spliced transcription factor XBP-1 mRNA and synthesize tyrosine-containing proteins at wild-type levels. Heterozygotes express 50% of wild-type levels. Extracts of Trpt1+/+cells have measurable NAD+-dependent 2'-phosphotransferase activity.

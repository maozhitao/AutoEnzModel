SA	Taxus chinensis	-999	*	*Replacement of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase with the enzyme from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and codon optimizing of the Taxus chinensis taxadiene synthase gene to ensure high-level expression, resulting in a 40fold increase in taxadiene to 8.770.85 mg/l as well as significant amounts of geranylgeraniol (33.1 mg/l)
SA	Taxus baccata	-999	*	*a relatively high level of activity is observed at day 4, when it is 2.8-, 6.8-, 3.2- and 1.7fold higher, respectively, in the cultures treated with 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/l taxol than in the untreated control (6.64 pkat/mg of protein). Enzyme activity then decreases markedly from days 4 to 12 and thereafter is measurable only at a very low level until day 20.

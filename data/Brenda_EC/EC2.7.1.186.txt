KCAT	Thermoplasma acidophilum	9	(R)-3-phosphomevalonate	*pH 8.0, 60&Acirc;&deg;C
KM	Thermoplasma acidophilum	-999	(R)-3-phosphomevalonate	*pH 8.0, 60&deg;C, it is not possible to accurately determine the Km for mevalonate-3-phosphate-5-kinase, however, because the substrate is not commercially available and the detection limit of the assay is 0.03 mM substrate. The enzyme is still at Vmax when it is assayed with 0.06 mM mevalonate 3-phosphate, indicating that the Km is well below 0.06 mM

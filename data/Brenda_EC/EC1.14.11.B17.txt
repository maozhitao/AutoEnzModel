KCAT	Kutzneria sp. 744	-999	more	*nonhydrolyzable coenzyme A analogs are developed and used to determine the kinetic parameters for KtzO-catalyzed hydroxylation of glutamic acid bound to the carrier protein. To determine the kinetic parameters of KtzO catalyzed hydroxylation, the problem of the labile thioester bond is circumvented by using synthetic coenzyme A analogs coupled to glutamic acid where the thioester is replaced by a hydrolytically stable amide bond

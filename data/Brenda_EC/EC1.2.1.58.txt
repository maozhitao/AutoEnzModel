The enzyme complex consists of a core enzyme of 4 subunits with the composition alpha2beta2gamma2delta2, this complex is able to reduce viologen dyes. The holoenzyme contains in addition an epsilon2 unit that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from a small ferredoxin-like subunit of the core complex to NAD, this unit also catalyzes the transhydrogenase reaction, carries FAD and resembles ferredoxin:NAD(P)+-oxidoreductase

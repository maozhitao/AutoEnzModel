SA	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*amounts and activities of napsin A studied by immunoblotting and specific substrate cleavage, general defect in napsin A expression or activity not observed as cause for abnormal surfactant accumulation in juvenile pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
SA	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*napsin A as a diagnostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma tested, comparative study between napsin A and thyroid transcription factor TTF-1 by immunohistochemical analysis, napsin A reactivity in more than 75% of the tumor cells in 9/10 positive cases obtained, napsin A shown to be useful as an alternative marker to thyroid transcription factor TTF-1 in cytological diagnosis of effusions with low amounts of tumor cells
SA	Homo sapiens	-999	*	*expression of napsin A determined by mRNA in situ hybridization in renal cells, tumor-suppression activity determined, mutation of one of the aspartic acid residues in the napsin A catalytic site shown to affect enzyme activity but not processing, glycosylation or intracellular localization, napsin A shown to inhibit tumor growth of transformed cells by a mechanism independent of its catalytic activity
SA	Mus musculus	-999	*	*napsin A-expressing cells shown to form tumors in SCID mice with lower efficiency and slower onset compared to vector-transfected control cells

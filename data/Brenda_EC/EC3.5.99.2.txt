SA	Alosa pseudoharengus	-999	*	*mean thiaminase activity in the alewives studied increases from 6.9 to 16.0 nmol/min/g from the time of their collection in Cayuga lake to the start of laboratory experiments 1.5-2.5 years later, the latter value is more than twice that of previously reported levels of thiaminase activity from alewives collected in the wild, data suggest that the variability in thiaminase activity is not related to stress from salt reduction or food limitation; whole body activity is measured, no significant diferrences in thiaminase activity are found between the control fishes and the alewives which are exposed to food limitation and reduced salt content in the water
